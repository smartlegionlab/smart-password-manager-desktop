## üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Password Manager for Smart Passwords

A professional, cross-platform desktop application for managing and generating smart passwords using deterministic cryptography. Provides a graphical interface for the innovative password management paradigm.

> **Powered by** [smartpasslib](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/smartpasslib) - The core library for deterministic password generation

## üåü Key Features

- üéØ **Visual Management** - Intuitive interface for managing password credentials
- üîí **Zero Password Storage** - Passwords are generated on-demand, never stored
- üñ±Ô∏è **One-Click Generation** - Instant password generation with a single click
- üìÅ **Project Organization** - Organize credentials by projects and categories
- üîç **Quick Access** - Efficiently manage and access your login information
- üìã **Clipboard Integration** - One-click copy to clipboard functionality

---

Your passwords don't need to be stored because they were never created - they already exist as mathematical certainties, waiting to be discovered through the correct combination of login and secret phrase.
